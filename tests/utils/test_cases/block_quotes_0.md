## Question

Can you put block quotes within a table? (Please render the table in markdown.)

## Answer

Sure, here is an example of a table with a blockquote in one of the cells:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|---|---|
| This is a normal cell. | This is a normal cell. |
| This is a blockquote: | > This is a blockquote. It can be used to quote text from another source. |

As you can see, the blockquote is displayed as a indented paragraph within the table cell. You can also use blockquotes in other table cells, such as the header cells or the footer cells.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
