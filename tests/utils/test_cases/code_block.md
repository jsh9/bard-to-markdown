## Question

Can you show me how to write print "hello world" in Python?

## Answer

Sure. Here is how you can write `print "hello world"` in Python:

```
print("hello world")
```

The `print()` function is used to print text to the console. In this case, we are printing the string `"hello world"`. The string can be enclosed in either single quotes or double quotes.

Once you have written the code, you can save it as a file with a .py extension. For example, you could save the code as `hello_world.py`.

To run the code, you can use the `python` command. For example, you would type the following command to run the `hello_world.py` file:

```
python hello_world.py
```

This will print the following output to the console:

```
hello world
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Question

How about in Java?

## Answer

Sure. Here is how you can write `print "hello world"` in Java:

```
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello world");
    }

}
```

The `public` keyword indicates that the class is accessible to other classes. The `class` keyword indicates that the following code defines a class. The `HelloWorld` is the name of the class. The `public static void main(String[] args)` is the main method. The `System.out.println("hello world")` statement prints the string `"hello world"` to the console.

Once you have written the code, you can save it as a file with a .java extension. For example, you could save the code as `hello_world.java`.

To compile the code, you can use the `javac` command. For example, you would type the following command to compile the `hello_world.java` file:

```
javac hello_world.java
```

This will create a file called `hello_world.class`.

To run the code, you can use the `java` command. For example, you would type the following command to run the `hello_world.class` file:

```
java hello_world
```

This will print the following output to the console:

```
hello world
```
